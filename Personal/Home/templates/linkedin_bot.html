            <h2>LinkedIn Bot</h2>

            <br>

            <p><strong>*DISCLAIMER*</strong> - I want to preemptively state very emphatically that I respect the 
            privacy policy afforded by LinkedIn. In no way did I intend on desecrating that privacy policy 
            by creating this web scraper. All information compiled from the LinkedIn Bot was acquired through 
            public forum, with information that is readily available to anyone with a basic LinkedIn account. 
            This was all done so for the purpose of a "proof of concept" for my learning purposes. 
            I also failed to add blur to people displayed in the subsequent videos. For that I am sorry, 
            I tried to add a mosaic to block out information but I was unsuccessful.</p>

            <h5>.discover_new_people()</h5>

            <br>

            <p>In the first clip, my python Linkin Bot class is instantiated and executes it's first method,
            which, discovers new people. Here, it scrapes the suggested people's profile information from the network tab of LinkedIn. 
            All this information is set into a local database that is further parsed into smaller chunks.</p>

            <h5>.gather_data()</h5>

            <br>

            <p>In this second clip, my bot takes the information it acquired in the above video and goes out in search 
            of more personalized information. Here it simply visits the urls acquired from the initial scrape, gets the 
            job description from the candidate's URL and then cleans up some of the other info that was very brief in the 
            Discover New People tab.</p>

            <h5>.update_matches()</h5>

            <br>

            <p>In this third clip, the a text file with target search terminology is read into the LinkedIn_Bot class. Here, 
            it compares the Job Descriptions acquired from the above method against the search terms and flags certain individuals 
            as being 'Potential Candidates' in my job search.</p>

            <h5>.add_candidates()</h5>

            <br>

            <p>In this last clip, I once more reach into my database to pull out the potential candidates who's job description matches 
            my search terminology listed above. It shuffles the list, then goes back out to add each candidate iteratively.</p>

            <h5>.message_candidates()</h5>

            <br>

            <p>In the LinkedIn bot, there is another method that returns to the candidates that were added and flagged as so. It has a predefined message 
            that says something to the degree of "Hey I'm Jarret, looking to extend my network, etc..." but I'm not going to include that. I am very 
            respectful of the LinkedIn privacy policy and I felt as though doing so did violate those terms so I chose not to implement that method here.</p>

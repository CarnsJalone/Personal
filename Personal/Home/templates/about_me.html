    <div class="container">
        <p>Hey There!<p/>
        <p>My name is Jarret Laberdee. I’m 28 years old and very 
        enthusiastic about software design and web development. 
        I have become encapsulated with fascination about how technology 
        plays such a vital role in our day to day lives in our modern society. 
        It’s with this fascination that I continue to push myself to put new 
        hats on and learn new technologies.</p>

        <p>Despite not being formally education in Computer Science, 
        I possess the problem-solving capabilities to carry out any task 
        that I set my sights on.</p>
